# ADR 001: Dependency Injection Container

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The application needs a way to manage dependencies between services and components. We need to:
- Manage service lifecycle
- Enable easier testing through dependency injection
- Provide a centralized way to access services
- Support configuration management

## Decision

We will implement a singleton-based dependency injection container that:
- Manages service instances
- Provides type-safe service access
- Supports configuration injection
- Enables service mocking for testing

## Consequences

### Positive
- Centralized service management
- Easier testing through dependency injection
- Type-safe service access
- Better configuration management
- Reduced coupling between components

### Negative
- Additional complexity in service initialization
- Need to maintain service registration
- Potential for circular dependencies

## Implementation

The container is implemented in `src/core/container.ts` and provides:
- Singleton instance management
- Service registration
- Type-safe service access
- Configuration injection
