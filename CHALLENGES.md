# Project Challenges and Solutions

This document outlines the key challenges we've overcome during the development of this healthcare data mapping application, along with their solutions and the complexity involved in each case.

## 1. Select Element Testing Challenge ⭐

### Problem
Playwright tests were failing because we were trying to check visibility of `<option>` elements, which are never considered "visible" by Playwright.

### Solution
Implemented a three-step approach:
1. Wait for the select element itself to be visible
2. Wait for options to be present in the DOM
3. Select by index instead of value

### Complexity
This required deep understanding of how browsers handle select elements and Playwright's visibility checks. The solution involved:
- Understanding browser behavior with select elements
- Learning Playwright's visibility checking mechanisms
- Implementing proper wait conditions
- Using index-based selection for reliability

## 2. Graph Data Loading and State Management ⭐

### Problem
Tests were failing because they were trying to interact with elements before the graph data was fully loaded.

### Solution
Implemented proper loading states and wait conditions for the graph data.

### Complexity
Required careful coordination between:
- API calls
- State updates
- UI rendering
- Loading indicators
- Error handling

## 3. Form Dependencies Resolution

### Problem
Forms had complex dependencies that needed to be resolved before mapping could occur.

### Solution
Implemented a dependency resolution system that handles both direct and transitive dependencies.

### Complexity
Required understanding of:
- Graph theory
- State management
- Dependency cycles
- Circular reference handling

## 4. Field Type Validation

### Problem
Needed to validate field type compatibility between source and target fields.

### Solution
Implemented type checking and validation logic with clear error messages.

### Complexity
Required handling of:
- Type conversions
- Edge cases
- Validation rules
- User feedback

## 5. Healthcare-Specific Field Templates

### Problem
Needed to handle specialized healthcare field templates with specific validation rules.

### Solution
Created a template system with healthcare-specific field types and validation.

### Complexity
Required:
- Domain knowledge of healthcare data
- Template management
- Validation rules
- Field type compatibility

## 6. Data Preview Generation

### Problem
Needed to show real-time previews of mapped data.

### Solution
Implemented a preview system that updates as mappings are created.

### Complexity
Required:
- Efficient state management
- Real-time UI updates
- Data transformation previews
- Performance optimization

## 7. Complex Data Transformations

### Problem
Needed to support various data transformations (e.g., uppercase, date formatting).

### Solution
Created a transformation pipeline with validation and preview capabilities.

### Complexity
Required handling of:
- Different data types
- Transformation rules
- Validation logic
- Preview generation

## 8. Phone Number Validation ⭐

### Problem
Healthcare phone numbers needed specific format validation.

### Solution
Implemented regex-based validation with clear error messages.

### Complexity
Required:
- Careful handling of international phone formats
- Edge cases
- Clear error messages
- Real-time validation

## 9. Mapping Editor UI State Management

### Problem
The mapping editor needed to maintain complex state between different operations.

### Solution
Implemented proper state management for the editor's various modes.

### Complexity
Required coordination of:
- Multiple UI states
- User interactions
- State transitions
- Error states

## 10. Test Timeout Handling ⭐

### Problem
Tests were timing out due to complex async operations.

### Solution
Implemented proper wait conditions and increased timeout values where needed.

### Complexity
Required understanding of:
- Async operations
- Test timing
- Wait conditions
- State synchronization

## Most Challenging Issues

The issues marked with ⭐ required particularly complex solutions due to:

1. **Deep Technical Understanding**
   - Browser behavior
   - Testing tools
   - Async operations
   - State management

2. **Domain Knowledge**
   - Healthcare data requirements
   - Data validation rules
   - Field type compatibility

3. **User Experience**
   - Clear error messages
   - Real-time feedback
   - Performance optimization

4. **Testing Considerations**
   - Proper wait conditions
   - State synchronization
   - Edge case handling

5. **System Architecture**
   - State management
   - Data flow
   - Component interaction

These challenges have helped us build a robust system that can handle complex healthcare data mapping requirements while maintaining good test coverage and user experience.
